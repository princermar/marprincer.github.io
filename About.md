Greetings fellow lifeform! I'm Mar Princer, a theoretical-physicist-in-training at the National Institute of Physics, University of the Philippines Diliman. Despite being a BS Applied Physics undergraduate student, I mostly work on the theoretical/mathematical side of Physics *(I know, it's wild)*.

I am currently under the mentorship of the one and only [Jose Perico Esguerra](http://nip.upd.edu.ph/profiles/jose-perico-esguerra/) studying about the Hilbert Space Representations of Generalized Uncertainty Principle relations, Path Integrals in curved spacetime, and Exactly Solvable Dynamical models with Length and Momentum Uncertainties. I've stayed one extra year as an undergrad due to reasons I have no total control of and I hope to finish my degree this incoming academic year.

Aside from this, I'm currently trying to expand the knowledge in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Computer Vision that I've learned in our Applied Physics courses. So far, it has been a very inconsistent ride but it's fun. 

> I stopped at realtime face recognition in MATLAB.

In my free time, I write passages that may or may not rhyme, binge-consume literature (anime, webtoon, movies, korean series, etc...), and play FPS games *(valorant what??)*.

> I'm proud to say that I've read Solo Leveling in one seating.
