Hello there human! Welcome to this website! The name's Mar, a theoretical-physicist-in-training based in the Philippines (sadly). In this website, I'll show you a glimpse of my life as student in the National Institute of Physics, University of the Philippines Diliman.

## Why Physics?
Many would agree that physics is studied due to its interesting complexity which aims to unravel the secrets of the Universe; but I study physics to put myself into extreme pressure like no other fields in this world can radiate (see what I did there?).

I've always had the infatuation with the puzzle-like nature of mathematics yet despise its abstractness. Physics (at least some of it) provides pleasure for being tangible and easy to imagine. Combined with the rigorous mathematical challenges, I can say that the discipline suits my very nature.
