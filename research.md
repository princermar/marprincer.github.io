### Interest

**Generalized Uncertainty Principle, Quantum Gravity**, Mathematical Physics, Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks, Computer Vision, Relativity 
<br />
<br />
The core topic of my undergraduate thesis is to determine the effects of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle to the dynamics of different one-dimensional systems. I'm still in the process of calculating and solving for analytical solutions and I hope to publish the findings soon if I find them worthy of being published.
